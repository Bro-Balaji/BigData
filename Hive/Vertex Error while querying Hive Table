While running Hive Queries , the query failed with error
Vertex vertex_ [Reducer 2] killed/failed due to:OTHER_VERTEX_FAILURE]DAG did not succeed due to VERTEX_FAILURE. failedVertices:1 killedVertices:1
Solution

Check the Permission of /data/hdfs1*/yarn/nm/ directory

In our case the ownership of this directory was with yarn:yarn so this is causing the issue

Change the Permission of the /data/hdfs1*/yarn/nm/ to yarn:hadoop using below command
chown yarn:hadoop /data/hdfs1*/yarn/nm (Change in all the nodemanager servers)

Stop the YARN Service in the cloudera manager

After this delete the folders and files inside usercache directory using rm -rf /data/hdfs1*/yarn/nm/usercache/*

Start the YARN Service in Cloudera Manager

Run the hive query again and it will work
