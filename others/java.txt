This document is to explain how services  is going to pick the latest updated JDK in all  Environments.

Login to one of the server individually and download the Oracle JDK latest version from official site.
JDK download site : https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/

untar it on desired location and move the policy files(JCE Policies) [(/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_371/jre/lib/seecurity/) local_policy.jar & US_export_policy.jar] from old JDK version to new jdk version on the same location.

And move cacerts file from old JDK version from /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_371/jre/lib/seecurity/cacerts to the new JDK version which contains all the root certificates so that we do not repeat the steps of importing certificates on to the cacerts file.

Now tar this jdk where the JCE policy jars and cacerts files are placed and using a for loop send it across to all nodes.

For loop :

for i in 'all node' ; do scp -rp /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_371.tar.gz $i:/usr/java; done

Now login to all nodes and follow below steps to point the java to latest version.

alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin/java

alternatives --config java

alternatives --install /usr/bin/jar jar /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin/jar

alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin/javac

alternatives --set jar /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin/jar

alternatives --set javac /opt/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin/javac

Post these steps if we do java -version it should point to new version.

If we want we can export the latest JAVA path aswell.

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_333 && export JRE_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_333/jre && export PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_333/bin:/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_333/jre/bin


To remove previous alternates from java follow below commands.

There are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).


     Selection    Path                                     Priority   Status
    ------------------------------------------------------------
      0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/bin/java   3         auto mode
    * 1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/bin/java   3         manual mode
      2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java   2         manual mode
      3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java   1         manual mode

    Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:



    Now remove existing symbolic links first

    sudo update-alternatives --remove "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/javac"
    sudo update-alternatives --remove "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/jre/bin/javac"

    NOTE:

    1. Use the above mentioned commands carefully, always check whether any service/process is making use of the particular java version.
    2. The service might fail if we remove the java version if is service are using it.
