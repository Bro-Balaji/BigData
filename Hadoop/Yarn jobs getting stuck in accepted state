When checked on nodes on yarn UI ,all nodes where showing 0 vCores available eventhough just 3 or 4 jobs were running.

Notes:

From RM log we could see nodemanagers have 0 vCore available. So, UI was not showing the wrong info.
Then, we login to a nodemanager's host and found there are stale containers processes.
We killed all the processes and cleared the nodemanager statestore and nodemanager local cache directory. After restarting the nodemanger stared showing the current values.
To get the stale containers process ID

ps -ef|grep container |grep -v grep |awk '{print $2}'
To clear nodemanager statestore and nodemanager local cache directory

rm -rf /data/hdfsdata*/yarn/nm/*
rm-rf /var/lib/hadoop-yarn/yarn-nm-recovery/*
Cloudera Solution :

Kill all the running applications and stop all nodemanagers and follow the above steps.

According to Cloudera this is a permanent fix shouldn't happen again in future ,and further the cluster will be monitored for 2 - 3 days.
