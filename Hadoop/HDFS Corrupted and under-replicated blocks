Corrupted HDFS Blocks and Fix

The dfsadmin –metasave Command.

The dfsadmin –metasave command provides more information than that provided by the dfsadmin –report command. This command gets you various block-related pieces of information such as:

Total number of blocks
Blocks waiting for replication
Blocks that are currently being replicated

When you run the dfsadmin –metasave command, it creates a file in the /var/log/ hadoop-hdfs directory on the server where you executed the command.

hdfs dfsadmin -metasave metasave.out

Fix the corrupted blocks

hdfs debug recoverLease -path <file name> -retries 3

Fix the under replicated block

hdfs fsck -blockId <block id> -details -locations -files
