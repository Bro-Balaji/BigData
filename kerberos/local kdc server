yum install krb5-libs


configuring local kdc server
kdc.conf
once the required packages are installed go to /var/kerberos/krb5kdc and edit the following files
Take a backup of the original file
Then in the kdc.conf add the below lines and change the required parameters accordingly


[kdcdefaults]
 kdc_ports = {{ kdc_port }}
 kdc_tcp_ports = {{ kdc_port }}

[realms]
 {{ realm_name|upper() }} = {
  #master_key_type = aes256-cts
  acl_file = {{ kadm5_acl_path }}
  dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
  admin_keytab = {{ kadm5_keytab }}
  supported_enctypes = aes256-cts:normal aes128-cts:normal des3-hmac-sha1:normal arcfour-hmac:normal des-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-md5:normal des-cbc-crc:normal
 }

change the kdc ports and kdc_tcp_ports to 88
and in {{ realm_name|upper() }} add your realm which you want to use for the cluster
give the acl_file location which is /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl (which you will be creating certainly)
for the admin keytab you can have the location /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab (The keytab necessarily doesnt need to be there)


kadm5.acl
once it is done you have to edit the kadm5.acl as follows add the realm of the cluster here (by default it will be root make the changes accordingly)


krb5.conf
Once it is completed we have to edit thr krb5.conf file accordingly
Take a backup of the file before making any changes

Add the krb5.conf parameters in krb5.conf and make the changes accordingly



# Configuration snippets may be placed in this directory as well
includedir /etc/krb5.conf.d/

[logging]
 default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
 kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
 admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

[libdefaults]
 dns_lookup_realm = false
 ticket_lifetime = 24h
 renew_lifetime = 7d
 forwardable = true
 rdns = false
 pkinit_anchors = FILE:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
 default_realm = {{ realm_name|upper() }}

[realms]
   {{ realm_name|upper() }} = {
   kdc = {{ groups['kerberosserver'][0] }}
   admin_server = {{ groups['kerberosserver'][0] }}
  }

[domain_realm]
 .{{ realm_name|lower() }} = {{ realm_name|upper() }}
 {{ realm_name|lower() }} = {{ realm_name|upper() }}




here in the default_realm add the realm of your cluster
And in realms sections
Add your realm and the kdc server hostname and admin_server which will be same as your kdc serevr
And in domain_realm add the realm of the cluster accordingly



Initializing the local KDC server
Start the local kdc server

Here instead of giving the password directly we are storing it in a variable and calling it from the variable
read -a pass
And enter the password for the kdc server (Avoid more special characters)'
kdb5_util -P $pass create -s



starting the local KDC server
Once the configurations are set in place start the kdc server
systemctl start krb5kdc


systemctl start kadmin

You will be able to login into your local kdc server using
kadmin.local
